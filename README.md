# READ ME

This is an I2C communication protocol library which is used to communicate with the peripheral modules and devices. You may need to change some of the configuration bits with respect to your microcontroller's datasheet in order to use it for your own desire.  
  
**The library is specifically written for PIC16F877A microcontroller so I don't guarantee that it will work for the other types of PIC microcontroller family.**
